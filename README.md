# Cobalt2Demo

This is a repository of some demo codes by David Shen from Cobalt2 Poeject.
 * Folder "api" provides some sample apis.
 * Folder "autonomousTask" provides some demo tasks that run the robot. You may need to refer to the whole framework of Cobalt2 to implement those classes.
 * Folder "hardware" provides some sample hardware wrappers.
**************************************************************************************
Cobalt2 is the SDK that runs robots for FTC Competition.
It is a useful, versatile, consistent and reusable wrapper for ftc-app.
It is founded by FTCFoundation, an sub-organization under Avon Old Farms Schoolâ€™s robotics team.
From this repository, you could find some of the most important codes I wrote for Cobalt2
